# Working-Digital-Computer-WDC-1-Design-Files
STL and PCB design files for "How to Build a Working Digital Computer" based on the book of the same name.

I recently came across a book published in 1968 entitled "How to Build a Working Digital Computer" by Edward Alcosser, James P. Phillips, and Allen M. Wolk. Believers in the "learn by doing" philosophy, they show how to construct such a computer using "simple inexpensive components usually found around the house or in a neighborhood electrical parts store". This is often called the "paperclip computer" book since they use paperclips to create switches throughout the design.

There have been a few implementations based on the book over the years. A couple are pictured above. This project will document my efforts to make my own version of a "Working Digital Computer" henceforth to be called WDC-1. My intent is to use period technologies but modern building techniques like 3D printing and PCB fabrication. I will probably not use paperclips for switches.
